Say goodbye to the hassle of committing and pushing changes every time you need to test a workflow. This extension lets you quickly and efficiently run your workflows locally, leveraging the [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) CLI tool. Enjoy a seamless experience with an interface designed to feel as familiar as the official [GitHub Actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-github-actions) extension.

## Components

To run GitHub Actions locally, you will need the components denoted below. These can be installed and started up from the `Components` view.

1. [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act): Act is a CLI tool responsible for executing your workflows locally. It can be installed via several software package managers or using a pre-built artifact.

2. [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/): Docker Engine is required for act to function as it uses Docker to handle workflow execution. The process includes:
    
    * Pulling or building the images specified in your workflow files
    * Determining the execution path based on your workflow's dependencies
    * Running containers for each action using the prepared images
    
    The containers are configured to mirror GitHub's environment, including matching [environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#default-environment-variables) and [filesystems](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners#file-systems), ensuring a consistent and reliable local execution.
